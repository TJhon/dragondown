# What is `dragondown`?

.large[

  - `dragondown` is an R package that allows you to write your thesis in Rmarkdown
  
- Provides the required templates to properly format your thesis or dissertation in the Drexel format
  
- Easily integrate text, code and outputs 
  
- Allows you to focus on your research and not think about the minute formatting details often required with other text editors (e.g. LaTeX)

# Why use `dragondown`?

.large[`dragondown` takes all of the benefits of using Rmarkdown and wraps them up with a shiny bow*]

.large[Allows you to break about your dissertation chapters to make them more manageable while still bundling them all together correctly]

.large[Provides a structured framework for effectively storing all of the materials associated with your dissertation]

.footnote[*shiny bow includes handling all formatting requirements of a Drexel dissertation]

## The shiny bow (i.e. formatting)

.pull-left[
  .large[Writing a thesis is hard enough, why kill yourself worrying about something as minute as matching [exact formatting requirements](https://www.library.drexel.edu/~/media/Files/graduatecollege/forms/Thesis%20Manual.ashx?la=en)?]

  .large[If you write your thesis using the `dragondown` package, then the formatting is automatically handled for you with the help of a custom LaTeX template!]
