# What is `dragondown`?

.large[

  - `dragondown` is an R package that allows you to write your thesis in Rmarkdown
  
- Provides the required templates to properly format your thesis or dissertation in the Drexel format
  
- Easily integrate text, code and outputs 
  
- Allows you to focus on your research and not think about the minute formatting details often required with other text editors (e.g. LaTeX)
  
]

# What is Rmarkdown?

.xlarge[
A framework for authoring documents allowing you to easily integrate code and text to produce high quality output!

]

Benefits:
.small[
  - Integrate code directly into your text in a variety of languages (e.g. R, python, SQL, etc.)
- Reduces copy/pasting
- Allows users to integrate version control effectively
- Easily re-render if data (or anything else) changes

# Why use `dragondown`?

.large[`dragondown` takes all of the benefits of using Rmarkdown and wraps them up with a shiny bow*]

.large[Allows you to break about your dissertation chapters to make them more manageable while still bundling them all together correctly]

.large[Provides a structured framework for effectively storing all of the materials associated with your dissertation]

<br><br>
.xxlarge.center[**Reproducibility**]

.footnote[*shiny bow includes handling all formatting requirements of a Drexel dissertation]

## The shiny bow (i.e. formatting)

.pull-left[
  .large[Writing a thesis is hard enough, why kill yourself worrying about something as minute as matching [exact formatting requirements](https://www.library.drexel.edu/~/media/Files/graduatecollege/forms/Thesis%20Manual.ashx?la=en)?]

  .large[If you write your thesis using the `dragondown` package, then the formatting is automatically handled for you with the help of a custom LaTeX template!]

## Managing your chapters (i.e. index)

.pull-left[
.large[`dragondown` provides a structured framework for organizing your thesis]

.large[You can keep all of the files required for your thesis (e.g. book chapters, figures, R scripts)]
]

.xxsmall.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
fs::dir_tree("live-examples/index")
```
]
---
##`_bookdown.yml`
.small[

```
book_filename: "thesis"
chapter_name: "Chapter "
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "01-chap1.Rmd", "02-chap2.Rmd", "03-chap3.Rmd", "04-conclusion.Rmd", "98-references.Rmd", "99-appendix.Rmd"]
download: [["thesis.pdf", "PDF"], ["thesis.epub", "EPUB"], ["thesis.docx", "Word"]]
delete_merged_file: true
```
]

- `chapter_name`: sets the prefix for your chapters
- `rmd_files`: List the order of all of your .Rmd files. If you add a chapter then you need to add it here to include it in your book
